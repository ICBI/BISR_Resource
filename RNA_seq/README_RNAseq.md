## Comparison of the older microarray techonology vs RNA-seq

| Older technology                                                                      | Newer technology                                                                                         |
| Less sensitive                                                                        | More sensitive - can detect genes that have low expression                                               |
| Can only quantify gene expression                                                     | Can quantify gene expression, detect novel transcripts, gene fusions, single nucleotide variants, indels |
| Lower dynamic range - around 10^3                                                     | Can quantify expression across a larger dynamic range - more than 10^5                                   |
| Example platforms â€“ Affymetrix U133Plus2, Illumina BeadChip |Example sequencing machines: Illumina HiSeq, Illumina MiSeq 

## Processing of raw RNA-seq data
Raw RNA-seq data is in the form of FASTQ files.
