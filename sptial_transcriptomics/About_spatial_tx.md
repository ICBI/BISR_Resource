## What is it ?
* A groundbreaking molecular profiling method that allows scientists to measure all the gene activity in a tissue sample and map where the activity is occurring.
* Spatial information is preserved by studying intact tissue , so the RNA is profiled while it is in the tissue (Called RNA in situ)



## Technologies
In general there are two ways of doing this. Image reference from PMID: 35761361.

### (1) Microscropy (image) based methods that are done in-situ

**(a) In situ hybridization (ISH)**

How: This is done by hybridization of mRNAs to fluorescently labelled, gene-specific probes. Hybridization refers to polymerization of single-stranded mRNAs to single stranded probes with a complementary sequence. Transcript species can be imaged repeatedly with the same probes but different fluorophores to create a gene-specific barcode as in ISH.
 [PMID: 35761361].
Data: will be images

**(b) in situ sequencing (ISS) based methods** 

How: The transcripts are directly sequenced inside a tissue block . Short probes can be imaged to read along an amplified transcript and determine its sequence as in ISS.

### (2) NGS/Sequencing based methods

**(a) Arrays**

How: Arrays of spatially barcoded probes can be used to label mRNAs with a sequence indicating location before undergoing NGS.

**(b) Microdissection**

How: cells or regions of interest can be directly microdissected and their locations recorded before their transcriptomes undergo NGS.
