# BISR Tutorials: training material from Georgetown-BISR 

## About BISR
Faculty and staff at **Georgetown University Innovation Center For Biomedical Informatics** (Georgetown-ICBI) provide expert support services and work with researchers to select what data analysis approach could be most insightful for different studies, clinical datasets organization, and running data through bioinformatics pipelines to help answer research questions. 

Consultations often involves study guidance, information about available resources, systems and tools, and analytic services depending on the scope of the project. The general areas of consultation include: next generation sequencing analysis, molecular profiling analysis, big data analytics, data integration, visualization, systems biology analysis, G-DOC, and bioinformatics software training. 

These services are offered to the Georgetown Univiersity community through the **Biomedical Informatics Shared Resource (BISR)**
